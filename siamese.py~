class Siamese(object):
    """
    This class implements a siamese convolutional neural network in
    TensorFlow. Term siamese is used to refer to architectures which
    incorporate two branches of convolutional networks parametrized
    identically (i.e. weights are shared). These graphs accept two
    input tensors and a label in general.
    """

    def inference(self, x, reuse = False):
        """
        Defines the model used for inference. Output of this model is fed to the
        objective (or loss) function defined for the task.

        Here we recommend you to consider using variable and name scopes in order
        to make your graph more intelligible for later references in TensorBoard
        and so on. You can define a name scope for the whole model or for each
        operator group (e.g. conv+pool+relu) individually to group them by name.
        Variable scopes are essential components in TensorFlow for parameter sharing.
        You can use the variable scope to activate/deactivate 'variable reuse'.

        Args:
           x: 4D float Tensor of size [batch_size, input_height, input_width, input_channels]
           reuse: Python bool to switch reusing on/off.

        Returns:
           l2_out: L2-normalized output tensor of shape [batch_size, 192]

        Hint: Parameter reuse indicates whether the inference graph should use
        parameter sharing or not. You can study how to implement parameter sharing
        in TensorFlow from the following sources:

               CIFAR10 and is 0 otherwise.
